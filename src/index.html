			<p><strong>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>1962</strong> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li>

				<li><strong>1970</strong> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>

				<li><strong>1983</strong> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>

				<li><strong>1984</strong> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>

				<li><strong>2005</strong> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>

				<li><strong>2009</strong> - dies at the age of 95.</li>

			</ul>

				<p>"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."</p>
