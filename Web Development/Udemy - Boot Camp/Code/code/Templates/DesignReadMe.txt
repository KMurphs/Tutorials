rules of thumb
	Big bold black header - light small grey subheader (or white header and lightly transparent subheader)
	dont play with fancy colors, gray scale is amazing (0 50 87 162 209 255) eg gray scale plus one green
	design = space
	filter and shadows to increase contrast
	good design is not made obvious ot the eye
	keep proportions as opposed to same size

Design Fundamentals
	color and contrast
		you are making important stuff pop while less important fade in the background
	white space
		consistent spacing
		clustering
		left right top and bottom inter element spacing
	visual hierarchy
		what's important should pop out 
	complexity vs simplicity
		less is better
	consistency
		fonts, colors, alignements, within page across website
	scale
		proportions and sizes
