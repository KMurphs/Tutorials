# [A Simple Predictive App using React for User Interface and Flask and python for the server backend](https://towardsdatascience.com/create-a-complete-machine-learning-web-application-using-react-and-flask-859340bddb33)



## [The Server](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-flask-a-python-microframework)

### Setting Up

Ensure that python is installed and note the version installed
```
Î» python
Python 3.7.3 (default, Mar 27 2019, 17:13:21) [MSC v.1915 64 bit (AMD64)] :: Anaconda, Inc. on win32

Warning:
This Python interpreter is in a conda environment, but the environment has
not been activated.  Libraries may fail to load.  To activate this environment
please see https://conda.io/activation

Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```
Version is ``3.7.3`` and is installed globally.


In due time, the server will be moved to a docker container. But for now, we will set up the server locally.
> We'll start by installing virtualenv, a tool to create isolated Python environments. We need to use virtual environments to keep the dependencies used by different Python projects separate, and to keep our global site-packages directory clean. We'll go one step further and install virtualenvwrapper, a set of extensions that make using virtualenv a whole lot easier by providing simpler commands.

```
$ pip install virtualenv
$ pip install virtualenvwrapper 
```
However, on windows, the last command must be replaced with ``pip install virtualenvwrapper-win``. From thereon,
```
cd server
mkvirtualenv react-flask-ml-server
workon react-flask-ml-server
```
We have created a virtual env ``react-flask-ml-server``, we have activated it and are using it.
View the current virtual env with ``pip -V``

Now, let's install flask
```
$ pip install Flask
```
The following command prints out the dependencies installed with flask.
```
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt
Click==7.0
Flask==1.1.1
itsdangerous==1.1.0
Jinja2==2.10.1
MarkupSafe==1.1.1
Werkzeug==0.15.5
```

> What do all these packages do? 
> Flask uses Click (Command Line Interface Creation Kit) for its command-line interface, which allows you to add custom shell commands for your app. 
> ItsDangerous provides security when sending data using cryptographical signing. 
> Jinja2 is a powerful template engine for Python.
> MarkupSafe is a HTML string handling library. 
> Werkzeug is a utility library for WSGI, a protocol that ensures web apps and web servers can communicate effectively.


### server.py

```
echo #Hello World  > server.py
sublime server.py
```

> We use the __name__ argument to indicate the app's module or package, so that Flask knows where to find other files such as templates. 


### Running the server
```
# $ export FLASK_APP=server.py
$ set FLASK_APP=server.py
$ flask run
 * Serving Flask app "server.py"
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
A visit at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ yield the hello world from the server.py

### General Repo setup 

```
mkdir app app\templates app\static
```
> Most Flask apps have the following basic file structure:

> run.py: This is the application's entry point. We'll run this file to start the Flask server and launch our application.
> config.py: This file contains the configuration variables for your app, such as database details.
> app/__init__.py: This file intializes a Python module. Without it, Python will not recognize the app directory as a module.
> app/views.py: This file contains all the routes for our application. This will tell Flask what to display on which path.
> app/models.py: This is where the models are defined. A model is a representation of a database table in code. However, because we will not be using a database in this tutorial, we won't be needing this file.
